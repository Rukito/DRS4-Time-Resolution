# Estimation of DRS4 Channel Time Resolution
Program creates root file with tree containing differences
between signals from 2 DRS4 channels.

# Quick usage:
1.Compile code in src folder.
2.Use binary_readout to change data format (program creates root file in root_files folder; 
file has the same name as binary file).
3.Use Analyzer to calculate signal delay between channels.
